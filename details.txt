Here’s a detailed, line-by-line explanation of your Python script for the ML-based Green Bond Recommendation System. I'll cover the purpose, structure, logic, and the machine learning model used.

📦 Library Imports
python
Copy
Edit
import os
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score
from openpyxl import Workbook
os: Provides functions to interact with the operating system.

pandas: Used for reading, cleaning, and manipulating data.

numpy: Used for numerical operations like mean calculation.

sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor: The ML model used to predict how much green bonds should be recommended.

sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split: For splitting the data into training and testing sets.

sklearn.metrics: Used to evaluate model performance (MSE and R²).

openpyxl: Used for writing Excel files (.xlsx).

🧮 ESG Score Normalization Functions
python
Copy
Edit
def normalize_sustainalytics(score):
    ...
def normalize_lseg(score):
    ...
def normalize_msci(rating):
    ...
These three functions normalize ESG scores from different rating agencies (Sustainalytics, LSEG, MSCI) into a consistent scale from 0 to 10.

Sustainalytics: Lower is better (risk-based), so we reverse the scale.

LSEG: Higher is better (already on a 0-100 scale), scaled down.

MSCI: Converts ratings like AAA, AA, A etc. to numerical values.

📄 Load and Parse ESG Data
python
Copy
Edit
def load_esg_data(csv_file, company_name):
    ...
Reads ESG ratings from a CSV.

Standardizes column names.

Extracts scores per agency.

Normalizes them.

Computes the average ESG score (on a 1-10 scale).

🧠 Load Sentiment Score
python
Copy
Edit
def load_sentiment(txt_file):
    ...
Reads a sentiment score from a .txt file (e.g., from NLP analysis).

Expected format: "Sentiment: 0.75" → extracts the float value.

🤖 ML Model: Recommend Green Bonds
python
Copy
Edit
def recommend_green_bonds_ml(...):
    ...
This is the core logic of the application. Here's how it works:

1. Score Computation
python
Copy
Edit
msci_boost = 10 if esg_data['MSCI'] >= 8.5 else 5
overall_score = ...
Combines weighted ESG scores from different agencies.

Adds a boost for high MSCI scores.

Adjusts based on sentiment analysis score (sentiment_impact).

2. Data Engineering
python
Copy
Edit
bond_data['Quality Score'] = ...
bond_data['SECTOR_SCORE'] = ...
bond_data['REVIEWER_SCORE'] = ...
Creates features for ML: sector, external reviewer, amount issued, etc.

3. Model Training
python
Copy
Edit
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = ...
model = RandomForestRegressor(...)
model.fit(...)
Trains a Random Forest Regressor to predict "Recommended Quantity".

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and control overfitting.

4. Performance Metrics
python
Copy
Edit
y_pred = model.predict(...)
print(f'Model Performance: MSE = ..., R2 = ...')
Evaluates model using:

MSE (Mean Squared Error): Lower is better.

R² (Coefficient of Determination): Closer to 1 means better fit.

5. Generate Recommendations
python
Copy
Edit
if row['BOND_TYPE'].lower() == 'green':
    ...
Based on the final score, assigns a bond a Buy/Hold/Strong Buy recommendation.

6. Prepare Buffers
python
Copy
Edit
recommendations_df['Buffer 1'] = buffer1
...
Adds ESG score-based buffers for interpretation & filtering.

💾 Save Results to Excel
python
Copy
Edit
with pd.ExcelWriter(output_file, engine='openpyxl') as writer:
    ...
Saves both ESG and recommendation data to separate sheets in an Excel file.

🏁 Driver Code
python
Copy
Edit
company_name = 'Allianz SE'
esg_data = load_esg_data(...)
sentiment_score = load_sentiment(...)
bond_data = pd.read_csv(...)
...
recommend_green_bonds_ml(...)
Loads and prepares data.

Calls the ML-based recommendation engine.

Saves the final output as an Excel file.

🤖 Summary of ML Algorithm
Random Forest Regressor

Type: Supervised Regression

Trees: Builds multiple decision trees using bootstrapped samples.

Aggregation: Averages predictions from all trees.

Pros:

Good accuracy

Robust to outliers

Handles non-linearity well

Use Case Here: Predict "Recommended Quantity" of green bonds based on ESG, sentiment, issuer sector, etc.
